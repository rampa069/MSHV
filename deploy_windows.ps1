#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Build + package MSHV for Windows x86_64 (MinGW Qt5).

.DESCRIPTION
  Produces dist\MSHV-<version>-windows-x64.zip with MSHV.exe, the Qt5
  runtime DLLs deployed by windeployqt, the bin\settings tree, and a
  README. The .pro file already links FFTW + DirectSound statically, so
  the only DLLs in the bundle are Qt + MinGW runtime.

.PARAMETER Version
  Version string used in the zip filename. Defaults to "dev".

.NOTES
  Requires qmake, mingw32-make, and windeployqt on PATH. On the CI runner
  these come from jurplel/install-qt-action with arch=win64_mingw81 (and
  tools_mingw if mingw isn't on the runner's PATH already).

MSHV $Version - Windows x64

This bundle is self-contained: Qt5 + MinGW runtime DLLs were deployed
next to MSHV.exe by windeployqt. FFTW and DirectSound are statically
linked into the executable.

Run by double-clicking MSHV.exe.

If Windows SmartScreen blocks the first launch, click "More info" then
"Run anyway". MSHV is not signed by a registered Microsoft publisher.
